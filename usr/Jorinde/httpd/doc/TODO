4.	Finish Digest authentication.

5.	Request is passed around too much (esp. around access-queries), in many 
	cases just passing on an URI is enough.

6.	When redirecting a file-download from localhost to /dev/null we only
	get a download-rate of 10meg/sec. Is it disk-access? It's a 7200 RPM
	disk: hdparm -tT /dev/hda
		/dev/hda:
		Timing buffer-cache reads:   480 MB in  2.00 seconds = 240.00 MB/sec
		Timing buffered disk reads:   78 MB in  3.06 seconds =  25.49 MB/sec
	We want to speed this up, where is the problem?

7.	FIXED PARTIALLY! Split up the entire Jorinde-package into the following 
	smaller packages:
		- XML - LUnit - LSP - HTTPD - DAVD - Shared libraries - Error-pages 
		- Documentation - Web-application - 'Tests' web-application

9.	Make server suitable for persistent environments (I have no idea how much
	work this might be. Not much?)

10	Make all important SYSLOG's go to logd->log()

11	data/httptool.c:
	2	I don't think OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1 will work yet.
	3	Ranges!
	4	http_tool->write_resource()
	5	cmd_delete
	6	cmd_trace
	8	partial get

12	We cannot handle logging of multiple applications, it will only log 
	for the last one in server.xml -- need to make the logger a clone.

13	rpl -R -x '.c' 'error("illegal call\n")' 'error("illegal call")' .

14	For consistency, rename all functions 'tostring' to 'to_string', or vice
	versa.
