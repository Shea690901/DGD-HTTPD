Regarding this Changelog
  Sometimes I add silly (not entirely factual) entries in this file because
  I like to keep things for historical reasons (other than in Subversion).

Version 0.1.0, 20-jan-2004
- Just experimenting with DGD's Kernel Library.

Version 0.2.0, 23-jan-2004
- No idea.

Version 0.3.0, 25-jan-2004
- No idea.

Version 0.3.4, 27-jan-2004
- No idea. 

Version 0.3.5, 29-jan-2004
- Started this Changelog.
- Major changes, but most important: Minimized number of files in System.
  Most of the work is now done in /usr/Jorinde/ and applications are in
  /usr/www/

Version 0.3.6, 12-feb-2004
- Introduced a handler for logging, no logging standard implemented yet.
- Multiple website hosting, server will clone applications.
  This has been a work in progress for some time; but should now be done.
- XML: I think this is somewhat stable now (it works for my purposes now)
- XML: Implemented a very minimal version of the xpath standard.
- Configuration of server and applications is done through XML-docs.

Version 0.3.7, 07-mar-2004
- XML: Element-attributes can now have escaped quotes.
- Logging-format is now defined in the xml-configuration file.
  Something that -could- be called NCSA logging is implemented. Check TODO's
  to make it comply.
- Finalized buffering and read-on-demand of big files (>48kb).
  Somewhat messy code, but it works. Also worked out limitations of MAX_ARRAY.
  This was a silly limitation since the actual data wasn't the problem.
- Started documenting code in /usr/System/httpd/obj/user.c
- Renamed all query_* functions to get_*.
  Some names are less than optimal due to this, but I feel that consistency
  is more important than the big mess of mixing the two (which I had).
  Exceptions are (of course) functions which are called by the kernel.
- Functions remove_whitechars and remove_crlf in lib/string.c are deprecated;
  use strip_whitechars() / strip_crlf()
- Added lower_case(), upper_case(), capitalize() to lib/string.c
- POST (multipart) now works as advertised.
  Split multi-part boundaries in content-array are finally taken into
  consideration.

Version 0.3.7, 14-mar-2004
- WebDAV implementation started.
  A work very much in progress, and probably will be for some time.
- Bugfix: complete-flag in data/post.c did not always work as advertised.
  Small files failed to upload every now and then. Forced to do completion
  check in a more expensive way.
- Moved things around quite a bit related to receiving content (POST etc).
  This to make it easier to implement WebDAV plus adding a bit more 
  consistency to request-content altogether. *sigh* Maximum string-size keeps
  on giving me grief when dealing with content.

Version 0.3.7, 16-mar-2004
- Added set/get_port() to lib/app.c.
  Called by server after initializing an application.
- Added support for plugins that want to support HTTP (extension) methods.
  Plugin-services are added in the server-configuration and will be available
  to all applications.
- Added ability to only support a limited subset of HTTP-methods.
  You set allowed commands on a per application basis. These values override
  plugged in services.
- More changes when it comes to how we deal with request-bodies.
  Grr. I do hate MIME in HTTP/1.x.

Version 0.3.7, 17-mar-2004
- /usr/Jorinde/dav/[lib, include, etc]
  Created.
- XML: Made it a little easier to add and create nodes in an XML-tree.
  Function insert() supported by element.c and root.c. This whole thing
  with being DOM-compliant will have to come another year. I'm mainly
  focusing on getting WebDAV to work at the moment and all changes I
  make elsewhere are needed in order to get that to work.
- DAV: Partial implementation of PROPFIND in place.
  Now we need to deal with the impact on security before we complete [it] and
  any other WebDAV method.

Version 0.3.8, 25-mar-2004
- Refactoring.
  Rearranging everything to minimize amount of code in ~System (again). This
  is a huge task as it needs a lot of rewriting due to my own stupidity,
  don't expect any new entries in this file for a while.
- And we compile and respond to (simple) requests again.
  This time we respect the Kernel Library for what it really is. We have a
  layer in ~System that we use to inherit from Kernel as opposed to having
  protocol related stuff in there. No matter how much I wish I could keep
  authentication within the ~System directory ... it just won't happen.
  Now we have another few days of cleaning up and fixing everything we broke.
- Methods now inherit standard wiztool.
  In the case of anonymous access the layer in /www/access.c is used.
- Simple events implemented which can be used by LWO's. 
  I am not sure on what impact this has on performance since we need to keep
  references to multiple instances (eg set in different threads). So I might
  very well undo this at some point.
- We only keep one response in pending state now, I was overly ambitious.
  I ran into problems when trying to keep multiple pending responses when
  I started to use events for LWO's. In fact, the more I use these events
  the more I am about to tear them out again.
- Some documentation written.

Version 0.3.9, 20-apr-2004
- Indent a string or a node of XML.
- Added a few configuration options (some still marked as TODO)
- Added a library containing array-realted helper functions.
- WebDAV: PROPFIND works.
- Introduced RFC 1123 datetime format.
- The error-pages handler works again.
- WebDAV: MKCOL works.

Version 0.3.9, 03-may-2004
- All file-operations done by web-methods now use the functions in lib/file.c
- Default documents are only taken into consideration in GET.
- WebDAV: DELETE works.
- Now ignoring port-number in Host-header.
- Partial implementation of arbitrary WebDAV properties.
- WebDAV: COPY works.
- WebDAV: MOVE works.

Version 0.3.10, 04-may-2004
- WebDAV: Setting and retrieving arbitrary properties on resources works.
- WebDAV: The propname action almost works (interim save) :).
- WebDAV: PROPPATCH works.
- Various other fixes and minor bugs taken care of.
- WebDAV: Nautilus now works as expected.
- WebDAV: A DAV-application-configuration was added.
- Support for multiple ports for applications.
  Prior to this all applications had to be on same port. This is done by
  setting a different binary manager for each port (this will just forward
  all requests to System's binaryd.c).
- A loop-hole in authorization daemon was fixed.
- Jorinde/lib/file.c: Don't use anonymous access if it's turned off.
- Plugged in tools (dav / http) are now cloned by System.
  This is a work in progress. NOTE: the tools are now BROKEN.
- Authenticated access now works properly (this had never been tested)

Version 0.3.11, 08-may-2004
- Fixed a number of bugs related to persistent connections which hadn't
  been tested for months. Functions clear/set_ttl() added to user to
  better keep track of this.
- WebDAV now seems to work in newer versions of Konqueror (older versions
  are still a problem)
- Some of Jorinde's own WebDAV properties now works.
- Fixed a problem that sent off a response before we got two CRLF's in
  a request (after headers).
- doc/TODO introduced
- Authentication cleanup.
- Checked in a bunch of RFC's related to the project.
- Partial implementation of Digest authentication.
- Complete rewrite of how URI's work (now their own object)
- Implemented a big-string class (still not used anywhere)
- A unit-test framework was written (this one is looking for a new home
  together with XML and the httpd-plugins)
- Unit-tests for a few programs were added.
- Separated connection-related code from obj/user.c into a lib.
- Many many bugfixes.

  lunit:  Jorinde Unit Test Framework
  shared: Jorinde Shared Libraries

  as well (string to int etc)

- POSTed Content-Type 'x-www-form-urlencoded' now works as expected.
- url encode/decode library introduced (currently only decode).
- html errord is now enabled.
- Added wrappers for session/server and you can now set properties (etc) on
