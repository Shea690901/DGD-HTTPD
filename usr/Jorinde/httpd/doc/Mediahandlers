The Mediahandlers

Setting up a mediahandler
	To add a new mediahandler to the httpd you need to add a hook in the 
	applications configuration file.
	By default this is: ~Jorinde/httpd/config/default-app.xml

	For a module formatting .txt files to more readable html, you might 
	add something like this:

		<media-type>
			<file-suffix>txt</file-suffix>
			<content-type>text/plain</content-type>
			<handler>
				<program>/usr/Jorinde/plugins/mh/txt2html</program>
			</handler>
		</media-type>

	/media-type/handler/program/ is the actual program that the functions
	below will be called in. The rest of the XML should be self-explanatory.


The API used to talk to Mediahandler Plugins

	You need to inherit the mediahandler API and library by doing something
	like the following in your plugin:

	inherit api API_HTTP_MEDIAHANDLER;
	inherit lib LIB_HTTP_MEDIAHANDLER;

	Then a few functions are expected, these are outlined below.

	int get_supports(string filesuffix)					[mandatory]
		Gets called before anything else, the httpd verifies that the plugin
		indeed supports the filesuffix. Should return TRUE (1) if it can
		handle the mediatype. FALSE otherwise.

	int handle(object request, object response)			[mandatory]
		Handle the content in the response and modify as you see fit. You 
		have full access to headers, content, the originating request.


Disclaimer
	There is more functionality available, but this is the basics.
