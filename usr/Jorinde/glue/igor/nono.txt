Nono Thraeryn says: Hmm, your package has an include dir, which contains a
                    lot of files with same names in the mudlib.
You think carefully.
You say: Ah right
You say: Okay, this is the deal>
You say: DGD is shipped with its own Kernel Library.
Nono nods solemnly.
You say: _nothing_ in the Kernel Library is -modified- in any way.
Nono Thraeryn says: Yeah, as /dgd/mud/
Nono nods solemnly.
You say: So the only thing you -need- is the directories in /usr/
You say: Then follow the directions in the /usr/Jorinde/glue/
Nono Thraeryn says: Ahh
Nono nods solemnly.
You say: admin you can forget about as well
Nono nods solemnly.
You say: So under the Kernel Library the structure is like this: Jorinde
         contains the actual server, System contains privileged objects which
         can inherit from the Kernel, and www is the actual webroot (seprated
         from everything else due to security)
You say: Under Igor the story is slightly different since Igor doesn't have a
         privileged directory like System.
Nono nods solemnly.
You say: So, in theory, System could go under Igor since it's got no real
         function -- but I didn't want to move it out of the way for Igor
         since that would mean duplicate code... So Igor does depend on code
         in there.
Nono nods solemnly.
You say: 'could go' as in 'not needed'
Nono nods solemnly.
-------------------
You say: then when that is done you need to change one file to tell the httpd
         that you're on Igor: /usr/Jorinde/open/jorinde.h
----
Nono Thraeryn says: Did you use the current homemud build?
You think carefully.
You say: I -think- so, but then again, I might not have since I was gone for
         quite some time. :)
You say: You might want to patch driver.c by hand
Nono nods solemnly.
You say: Just check for __HTTPD__ in there
Nono nods solemnly.
