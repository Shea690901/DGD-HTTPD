This directory contains the files needed to glue the httpd to Igor.

The mudlib/ directory contains the files which were patched in the mudlib, 
which will have to be moved elsewhere (obviously).
---

The *.c files in this directory should be left in this directory.

patched file			move to location (/ is mudroot)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
mudlib/Jorinde		->	/adm/domains/Jorinde
		- description of the domain

mudlib/System		->	/adm/domains/System
		- description of the domain

mudlib/config.h		->	/include/config.h
		- added a # define __HTTPD__ to easily enable/disable it

mudlib/driver.c		->	/kernel/sys/driver.c
		- added function set_binary_manager() which associated a port
		  with an object.
		- static object binary_connect() now takes 'int port' as argument.

mudlib/preload		->	/conf/preload
		- added players/System/initd

mudlib/httpd/*		->	/obj/secure/player/httpd/*
		- move this whole directory (only contains one file with one function;
		  passwd.c->get_password()
		- adds functionality for http/dav to authenticate a user when they
		  log in using Basic authentication (it returns a users password)

mudlib/kernel/*		->	/include/kernel/*
		- move this directory (it contains dummy files to make default 
		  managers at least compile)

To switch from Kernel to Igor Glue change /usr/Jorinde/open/jorinde.h. 
You need to change the 'USE_GLUE_FOR_XXX', XXX to IGOR.

That's it. Add security where needed, especially in driver.c, only one object
should be able to call that one. I deliberately didn't add any security. :P

This will need a security audit or three before it can go into Igor in the
first place since it counts on the Kernel Library's security mechanism.
