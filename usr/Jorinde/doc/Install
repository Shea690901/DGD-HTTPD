This file is largely a TODO, but for now this is a start...

Checklist to set up a fresh install of DGD and the HTTPD:

[x] Download the Jorinde Package.

[ ]	Download DGD from ftp://ftp.dworkin.nl/pub/dgd/experimental/ then pick
    the platform of your choice (the newer version the better), either you
	download a binary or you compile your own.

[ ]	Install DGD. 
	You don't have IPv6 on your machine and you are compiling your own DGD?
	Modify the Makefile to have -DINET6=0 (1 is default).

[ ]	Move directories in the Jorinde package into DGD_INSTALL_PATH/mud/usr/.
	The 'mud' directory is the root of your DGD world ('/' from now on).
	After copying you should have /usr/Jorinde, /usr/System/ and /usr/www/.

[ ]	Set up DGD to listen to two ports (default configuration of the httpd
	wants port 80 and 81), edit /dgd/mud.dgd and change the binary_port
	in the config to this:
		binary_port = ([ "*":6048, "*":80, "*":81 ])
	...on older versions of DGD you want to do this instead of the above:
		binary_port = ({ 6048, 80, 81 });

	The alternative is to use the 'mud.dgd' included in the packaged version
	of this application and just change the path to suit your system. At 
	the time of writing, 'mud.dgd' was not in the SVN-repository, though.

[ ]	You -might- want to examine the settings for the httpd; 
	/usr/Jorinde/httpd/config/*.xml, server.xml is the starting point and
	anything that isn't referenced from that file can be ignored. :-)

[ ]	Start up DGD using the 'mud.dgd' file as in argument (or if you use
	Microsoft Windows, use 'Open' from menu)
