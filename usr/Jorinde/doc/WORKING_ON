           """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
- Dependencies on objectd (__HAVE_OBJECTD__) causes problems for people 
  without objectd, fix!
- The conditional GET doesn't work -- it will NEVER return a new copy if
  an etag comes with the request.
- DAV does not work with Windows XP's client.
- Phase out lib/content and data/content and replace with bstr.
- Finish HTTP/1.1 GET/PUT's conditional and partial fetches. (Need to make 
  it work with bstr first).
- HTTP PUT (need to make it work with bstr first).
- Add 'the new' object-types all over the place (this is more refactoring)
- Split up the documentation directory in the httpd to reflect that we are
  now several sub projects.
