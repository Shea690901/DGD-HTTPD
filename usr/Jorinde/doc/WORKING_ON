           Currently in the pipeline or things I'm working on
           """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
- Move all documentation to html-format in www/webroot/html/
- explode/implode in bstr.c, need testing
- Make SYSLOG() go to a separate log-file, a couple of exceptions:
  startup-message of httpd, error-logging should go to stdout, possibly
  also a FEW other ones.
- Dependencies on objectd (__HAVE_OBJECTD__) causes problems for people 
  without objectd, fix!
- The conditional GET doesn't work -- it will NEVER return a new copy if
  an etag comes with the request.
- Phase out lib/content and data/content and replace with bstr.
- Finish HTTP/1.1 GET/PUT's conditional and partial fetches. (Need to make 
  it work with bstr first).
- HTTP PUT (need to make it work with bstr first).
- Split up the documentation directory in the httpd to reflect that we are
  now several sub projects.
